<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Ok so welcome to my JS & Selenium Test Framework. The purpose of this framework was for myself to get some valuable learning of using Javascript and selenium together. When I got a new role this was the core languages and tools of the framework and
I wanted to get to grips with things a bit further so decided to make this framework for my own learnings and understanding.

What to know:
* The Framework ustilises a BDD approach and using cucumber, selenium and superTest allows for the testing of 2 layers of the test pyramid that many QA focus on in there day to day.
* The test application is a free online site that lets test proffessionals practice there skills - https://demoqa.com/
* There is also a work in progress in the repo for GITHUB actions and CI testing.
* This is still a working framework that is being added to and branched quite often

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## How the Framework has been used

As mentioned the framework has been used as a learning expirence however that doesnt mean it was a free for all of code changes and the wild wild west. I planned the work using Trello and
running with agile methodologies. Each ticket was auto numbered and branches are made on these tickets as single items of work. Following best practices these are reviewed (yes by me being a 1 man band but in an ideal world PR by someone else) and merged into master. The below image is a representation of the workflow
